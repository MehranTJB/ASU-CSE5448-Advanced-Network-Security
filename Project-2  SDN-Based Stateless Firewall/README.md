In this lab, we wanted to set up and use an SDN-based firewall to mitigate network traffic attacks. In this lab we set up a software defined network based on mininet, containernet, POX controller, and OVS. We created an SDN infrastructure in a VirtualBox VM which had Ubuntu/Linux installed. Then we set up an SDN-based firewall to control and filter network traffic to block malicious and unauthorized network traffic.
