## Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection

In this lab I used the FNN algorithm to implement a machine learning-based anomaly detection model for network IDS. In this project, I used the pandas module to implement an ML model and analysis, the Numpy module for number processing, the data_preprocessor module for preprocessing the input data and NSL-KDD as the dataset. I made some changes in the fnn_sample.py code to accept different input as testing and training datasets.
